## Statement of Purpose

Being a student is a lot of fun.  
But at times it can get chaotic and you feel kind of lost.  
How far along am I? What else will be there for me? Am I making any progress?

This is why we have created Codetracker.  
Codetracker helps the developer student keep track of his progress, while being able to add summaries to the topics the student cares about. All in all, Codetracker should help create an overview for the student, so the student can concentrate on learning.
